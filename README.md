# CLPS0950-Project-Final
# EJR pushed this to github!
# written by JO
Before starting, please make sure you have pytorch and tkinter installed. 
This project is coded in python, we recommend using VisualStudioCode and a conda based Python interpreter such as: Python 3.8.5 64-bit (conda) 

Download the repository that will include the code, images, answerkeys, etc. The only changes necessary will be to define your current local path in zoom_game.py and GUI_mainscript.py. 

In order to process the code without directly seeing the image yourself and only seeing the models' output, comment out line 22 on crop_img.py and save the file

zoom_game.py will not work unless all the images and answer key are locally in your system and the pathway is changed to match yours. For this to work, change the directory in line 175 of zoom_game.py.
